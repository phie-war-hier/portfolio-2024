                <p class="description">Captcha Design Festival is organized by students of the University of Applied
                    Sciences Mannheim. It was taking place for the 8th time from 29. August – 09. September 2022. In three
                    different workshops the teachers and participants came together for one week to connect, learn new
                    techniques and work on creative projects. After this week the results were exhibited at Kunstverein
                    Mannheim. The topic for 2022 was »symbiosis – a cohabitation of analogue and digital«. We were very happy to welcome Cihan Tamti,
                    Guido Schmidt and Carolin Wanitzek as workshop leaders.</p>
                <p class="description">The opening of the festival was the symposium at the youth centre Forum in Mannheim. We invited
                    Ann Richter, Andreas Uebele and Julian Zimmermann as guest speakers, who gave our audience inspiring
                    talks. The workshops were the main part of the Captcha Design Festival. Lead by our workshop leaders, every
                    participant invented the meaning of »symbiosis« new. After three days of hard work, everything created in the 
                    workshops was exhibited at the Mannheimer Kunstverein. We held a Vernissage to open up the exhibition.
